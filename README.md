# ChasePoint-Game
This GAME is created using graphics and sound libraries in CPP.

- This game wants you to chase a given point from your current position just like a snake game.
- BUT you have to reach that point using the shortest path possible else you'll FAIL.
- Full instructions are given in the game.
- Using TurboC++/MSDOS is recommended.
- ENJOY.

Please note that this GAME still needs some features to be added and so your feedback will be helpful.
